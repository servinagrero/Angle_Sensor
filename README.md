# Distance sensor using a STM32 board

This code was used when learning the STM32 Nucleo board for the subject
microprocessors.

The board controls an ultrasonic sensor and a MMU attached to it. It uses the
sensor to scan a room in an angle and reports objects through the USART port.

The code was generated using STM32CubeMX.
